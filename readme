At Codemash 2014 I attended Telerik's "Code Dojo". There I did a Kata, the objective of which was to accurately keep score of a bowling game. I did about 75% of this during the Dojo, then added to it here and there throughout the rest of the afternoon. The code here represents about 4 hours of coding total. My main objective was to practice TDD, so it's not *too* bad, but it was quick and dirty enough that I didn't comment it much, and the string "rendering" class was kind of thrown together at the last minute just to make it more pleasant to test.
